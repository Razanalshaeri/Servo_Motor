# Servo_Motor
Servo motor is an electrical device which can be used to rotate objects (like robotic arm) precisely.
Servo motor consists of DC motor with error sensing negative feedback mechanism. This allows precise control over angular velocity and position of motor. In some cases, AC motors are used.
## How connect a servo to an Arduino?
Two ways, sweep and knob.
The sweep program will drive the arm of the servo back and forth while the Knob program will move the arm of the servo when you turn a potentiometer.
